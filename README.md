Updated Paragraph w/ GPT:

The solar system is commonly divided into inner and outer planets based on their position relative to the Sun and their physical characteristics. The **inner planets**—Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars—are located closest to the Sun, inside the asteroid belt. They are known as terrestrial planets because they have solid, rocky surfaces composed mainly of rock and metal. These planets are relatively small but dense, have few or no moons, lack ring systems, and experience shorter orbital periods, resulting in shorter years. Temperatures on the inner planets tend to be higher due to their proximity to the Sun, with Venus being the hottest because of its thick atmosphere and strong greenhouse effect.

The **outer planets**—Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune—are found beyond the asteroid belt and are much larger than the inner planets. They are composed primarily of gases and ices, which means they do not have solid surfaces like the terrestrial planets. Jupiter and Saturn are classified as gas giants, while Uranus and Neptune are known as ice giants due to their higher proportions of water, ammonia, and methane. The outer planets have many moons, all possess ring systems, and take much longer to orbit the Sun, resulting in long years. Because they are farther from the Sun, they are generally colder, although they exhibit dynamic atmospheres with strong winds and massive storms.
